Design Analog Mixed Signal blocks Using Open Source ToolsÂ©
===============================================================

Objectives
------------

* **The main aim of the lab** is to propose an Electronic Design Automation (*EDA*) based- Open Source framework for a Full-custom Integrated circuit (*IC*) design. The framework relies on the cooperation of Xschem for schematic editing, NGspice for circuit netlisting/simulating, and Python for data analysis. As a  result, the proposed open-source framework facilitates freely sharing and commercialization of the Integrated circuits design. A practical design circuit such as a level shifter circuit is utilized to emphasize the proposed open-source framework potentials from IC specifications to the GDSII file.

Tools/Packages Installation  
-------------------------------

* Since the proposed framework relies on **open-source tools**, they can be installed freely on MS Windows or Linux operating system. In practice, the tools have been installed on a Linux server, and users can log in remotely
